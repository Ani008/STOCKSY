/**
 * services/squareOffService.js
 *
 * Force-closes every open MIS (intraday) position at ~3:20pm IST,
 * before market close — this is what makes MIS actually "intraday"
 * rather than just "delivery with a cheaper margin requirement."
 *
 * Runs 10 minutes before the 3:30pm close to leave buffer for
 * execution — same reasoning real brokers use.
 *
 * Reuses placeOrder() rather than writing separate DB logic here,
 * so square-off orders go through the exact same path as a manual
 * sell: same brokerage calc, same wallet crediting, same trade
 * record, same NO_LTP retry safety net in the worker queue.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: this does not check the NSE/BSE trading holiday
 * calendar. On a holiday the cron will still fire, but since no MIS
 * positions could have been opened that day either, this should be
 * a no-op in practice (positions query returns empty). Worth adding
 * a holiday check later if that assumption ever proves wrong.
