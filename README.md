# Stocksy 
Full-stack real-time stock tracking app built with React Native (Expo), Node.js + Express, Redis, MongoDB, and Upstox WebSocket API.

---

## Project Structure

```
STOCKSY/
├── STOCKSY_MOBILE/     # React Native App (Expo)
├── STOCKSY_SERVER/     # Node.js + Express + WebSocket backend
└── backend_py/         # Python service — Upstox → Redis pipeline
```

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed before starting:

| Tool | Version | Check |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | 18+ | `node -v` |
| Python | 3.10+ | `python --version` |
| Expo Go | Latest | Install on your phone |
| npm | 9+ | `npm -v` |

> **Important:** Your phone and laptop must be on the **same WiFi network** for Expo to work.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ani008/stocksy.git
cd STOCKSY
```

---

## 2. Create ENV Files

You need **3 separate `.env` files** — one in each folder. Never commit these to Git.

### `backend_py/.env`
```env
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=
UPSTOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=     
```

### `STOCKSY_SERVER/.env`
```env
PORT=5000
REDIS_HOST=
REDIS_PORT=
REDIS_PASSWORD=
MONGO_URI=               
JWT_SECRET=              
```

### `STOCKSY_MOBILE/.env`
```env
API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_PC_LAN_IP:5000/api     # e.g. http://192.168.1.42:5000/api
API_TIMEOUT=10000
APP_ENV=development
```

> **How to find your LAN IP:**
> - Windows: run `ipconfig` → look for **IPv4 Address**
> - Mac/Linux: run `ifconfig` → look for `inet` under `en0`
>
> ⚠️ Do NOT use `localhost` in the mobile `.env` — your phone is a separate device and cannot reach your laptop via localhost.

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Python service
cd backend_py
pip install websockets redis requests protobuf python-dotenv

# Node backend
cd ../STOCKSY_SERVER
npm install

# React Native app
cd ../STOCKSY_MOBILE
npm install
```

---

## 4. Run the Project

You need **3 terminals open simultaneously.**

### Terminal 1 — Python Market Data Service
```bash
cd backend_py
python websocket_client.py
```
✅ Expected output:
```
Connection established
Saved to Redis: NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50 → {'ltpc': {'ltp': 23892.4, ...}}
```

### Terminal 2 — Node.js Backend
```bash
cd STOCKSY_SERVER
node server.js
```
✅ Expected output:
```
Redis connected successfully!
Server running on port 5000
WebSocket enabled on port 5000
```

### Terminal 3 — React Native App
```bash
cd STOCKSY_MOBILE
npx expo start
```
Then open **Expo Go** on your phone and scan the QR code from the terminal.

---

## 5. Verify Everything is Working

Run this in a separate terminal to confirm the full pipeline is live:
```bash
cd STOCKSY_SERVER
node test_ws.js
```
✅ Expected output (updates every second):
```
Connected to Stocksy Server!
Received: { type: 'MARKET_DATA', timestamp: ..., data: { 'NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50': { ... } } }
```

## Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `getaddrinfo failed` | No internet or expired Upstox token | Check internet. Regenerate token in Upstox Developer Console. |
| `Found 0 instruments in Redis` | Python service not running | Start `python websocket_client.py` first |
| `Network Error` in app | Wrong LAN IP in mobile `.env` | Run `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`, update `API_BASE_URL` |
| `port 5000 already in use` | Previous server still running | Run `npx kill-port 5000` then restart |
| `Cannot find module` errors | Wrong working directory | Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder before running |
| App shows "Off" indicator | WebSocket not reachable from phone | Confirm phone and laptop are on the same WiFi |
| `Metro bundler stuck` | Stale cache | Run `npx expo start --clear` |

---

## Notes

- The Upstox access token **expires every 24 hours**. Regenerate it from the [Upstox Developer Console](https://developer.upstox.com) and update `backend_py/.env` before starting each session.
- Market data only flows during **NSE trading hours** (Mon–Fri, 9:15 AM – 3:30 PM IST). Outside hours, Redis will have no data and the app will show "Loading...".
- The Python service auto-reconnects if the Upstox connection drops. The Node server does not need a restart unless you change `.env`.
